Problem 13:
A perfect number is a natural number equal to the sum of all its own divisors 
(all positive divisors other than the number itself).
Numbers that are not perfect are divided into two categories: insufficient and 
redundant numbers. An excess number is a positive integer n whose sum of positive 
divisors (other than n) exceeds n.
Similarly, an insufficient number is defined. One refers to insufficient numbers. 
The number 48, for example, is redundant because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 24 = 76, 76 > 48. 
The number 45 is insufficient because 1 + 3 + 5+ 9 + 15 = 33, 33 < 45. The number 28 is perfect, since
1+2+4+7+14=28.
You need to determine which category each element of a given sequence of natural numbers belongs to.
